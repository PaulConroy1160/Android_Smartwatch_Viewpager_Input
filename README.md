# Android Smartwatch Swipe Input

Smartwatches are used to provide limited information that is absorbed rapidly by the user. 
Using swipe inputs on a smartwatch allows more information to be presented to the user without
cluttering the screen.

A Viewpager uses 3 fragments, the middle fragment contains the content or question whereas the 
first and last fragments will act as the "input fragments". Once a user swipes onto an input fragment
a functon will trigger.
